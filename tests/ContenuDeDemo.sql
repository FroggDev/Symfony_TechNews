And watching the ever-shifting lights flicker in the sky above mountains, glaciers and vast lava fields is particularly breathtaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/travel/destinations/iceland\">Iceland</a>, the aurora borealis attracts everyone from professional photographers to travelers that have the phenomenon on their list of things to do before they kick it. You&#39;ll have the best chance of seeing the night lights when it&#39;s cold and dark outside and the aurora activity is high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cold isn&#39;t a factor, but the sky has to be clear, which it usually is on extremely cold nights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phenomenon is caused by solar winds, which push electronic particles to collide with molecules of atmospheric gases that cause an emission of bright light. The best time to see the northern lights in Iceland is from October to March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are forecasts predicting visibility at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vedur.is/\" target=\"_blank\">vedur.is</a>, the national weather website.

Atlantic beaches</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The pounding heart of Uruguay&#39;s summer scene, Punta del Este and satellite towns La Barra, Manantiales and Jose Ignacio are go-to beach destinations along the country&#39;s Atlantic coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the ocean lapping at one side of the Punta del Este peninsula and the Rio de la Plata on the other, high-rise hotels attract a glitzy Miami-style crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hipper beach bums in search of a relaxed experience head east to boho bolthole Jose Ignacio, a fishing village where Latin America&#39;s extremely wealthy pitch up in private mansions every January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norwegian hotelier Alex Vik has constructed three lodgings here, including the lovely<a href=\"http://estanciavikjoseignacio.com/indexENG.php\" target=\"_blank\">Estancia Vik</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accessing beaches such as Cabo Polonio and Punta del Diablo further north recently became a lot easier, with the opening of the circular Garzon Lake Bridge in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Newly designated heritage site</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the city of Colonia del Sacramento&#39;s historic quarter received UNESCO&#39;s seal of approval 20 years ago, Uruguay added a second accolade in 2015 -- for a meat packer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 263 hectares encompassing Paisaje Industrial Fray Bentos (<a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1464\" target=\"_blank\">Fray Bentos Industrial Landscape</a>) illustrate the entire meatpacking process and provide &quot;evidence of the interchange of human values between European society and the South American population of the 19th and 20th century,&quot; according to UNESCO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meat production plant turned museum received UNESCO cultural and industrial heritage status in July 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/10/travel/gallery/south-america-travel-olympics/\">10 South American hot spots you&#39;ll want to check out</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Montevideo</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Montevideo might be the world&#39;s most chilled-out capital, thanks to Uruguayans&#39; casual attitude toward life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home to about half the country&#39;s population, the pace is sedate here, where colonial architecture rubs shoulders with low-rise skyscrapers and 15 miles of beach-side rambla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A walkable city, musts include picturesque Ciudad Vieja and Barrio Sur neighborhoods and the fun if sometimes overrun Mercado del Puerto market, while a smattering of bronze founding fathers stand to attention in leafy plazas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Meat and greet</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A prime beef exporter -- and consumer at 81.5 kilos (about 180 pounds) a person a year -- it&#39;s clear Uruguayans take asado (barbecue) just as seriously as their Argentine neighbors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grass-fed cattle is the norm, with an abundance of lush pastures ending up as chivito (a stacked steak sandwich) or pamplona (fillet stuffed with cheese and red bell peppers then wrapped in bacon).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uruguay&#39;s fare also has a foothold on the haute cuisine map:<a href=\"http://www.theworlds50best.com/latinamerica/en/The-List/11-20/Parador-La-Huella.html\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Parador La Huella</a>&nbsp;in Jose Ignacio and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theworlds50best.com/latinamerica/en/The-List/31-40/La-Bourgogne.html\" target=\"_blank\">La Bourgogne</a>&nbsp;in Punta del Este are featured in Latin America&#39;s 50 Best Restaurants 2015 list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, top Argentine restaurateur Francis Mallmann, recently seen in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ8Htm4jAGc\" target=\"_blank\">Chef&#39;s Table</a>, runs an establishment in tiny rural village Garzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/14/travel/gallery/peru-bolivia-wonder-list/index.html\">Stunning aerials of Lake Titicaca, Machu Picchu and beyond</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Carnaval</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Rio de Janeiro doesn&#39;t hold an exclusive on Carnaval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uruguay&#39;s two-month celebration, which starts mid-January, is largely based on candombe, dance and rhythms devised by African slaves in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drums played by a 50-strong cuerda group and energetic dancing are at the heart of every street party, a more grassroots affair than its Brazilian cousin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Wine country</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fruity, tannin-high Tannat is Uruguay&#39;s star grape and though the wine industry is small at 70 million liters (comparable to a single mid-size Argentine winery&#39;s production), it&#39;s blossoming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With four key regions dotted along the coastline, you can easily sample Tannat in vineyards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous producers wine and dine the public in glorious settings, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bodegabouza.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bodega Bouza&nbsp;</a>in Canelones, which has picked up numerous trophies for its Albarino and Tannat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olive oil and winemaker&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bodegagarzon.com/?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Bodega Garzon&nbsp;</a>near Jose Ignacio is set to open the first LEED-certified winery outside the United States in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/06/foodanddrink/undiscovered-wine-regions/\">11 wine regions that fly under the radar (for now)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Colonia del Sacramento</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded by the Portuguese in 1680, this sleepy riverside town is one of Uruguay&#39;s oldest -- travel is pure time warp in Colonia del Sacramento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 17th-century convent, lighthouse and drawbridge form the heart of the UNESCO-protected Barrio Historico, while vintage automobiles lining quaint cobbled streets offer up a Havana-esque ambience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Carmelo</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While laid back towns are de rigueur in Uruguay, Carmelo takes relaxing to a heightened level of chic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located upriver and surrounded by vineyards and olive groves, visitors are entertained by water sports, golf, horse racing and polo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding upmarket lodgings, Hyatt recently took charge of prime riverside real estate, rebranding the Four Seasons as<a href=\"http://carmelo.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Carmelo Resort &amp; Spa</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.narbona.com.uy/\" target=\"_blank\">Narbona Wine Lodge&nbsp;</a>offers a great boho experience in a five-bedroom converted farmhouse overlooking Tannat vineyards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also pitch up in a glamping tent at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://posadacampotinto.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Posada Campo Tinto</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/09/travel/bourdain-paraguay-13-things/index.html\">Paraguay full of surprises for South America travelers</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Outdoor adventure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you take to the skies or the water, Uruguay&#39;s underpopulated landscape means you might be the only one taking on the waves at Punta del Diablo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From trekking with gauchos in Tacuarembo to kitesurfing at Laguna Garzon or hot air ballooning over vineyards, the outdoors is there for the taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Marijuana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can buy, sell and grow marijuana -- if you&#39;re Uruguayan. But it&#39;s not all harsh tokes for visiting weed smokers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decriminalized since 1974 and legalized in 2013, Uruguay&#39;s marijuana law is progressive and while it&#39;s illegal for visitors to purchase pot, they can certainly accept gifts or share a fat one with a Uruguayan friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/29/travel/insider-guide-buenos-aires/index.html\">Buenos Aires: Insider Travel Guide</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/travel/buenos-aires-free-things/index.html\">7 things to do for free in Buenos Aires</a></p>','uruguay-10-great-reasons-to-visit-a-south-american-treasure.jpeg',0,1,'2018-03-03 22:20:43'),

Here are eight of our favorites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Making of Harry Potter, London, United Kingdom</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/oscars-movie-travel-places/index.html?gallery=2\"><img alt=\"This mini Hogwarts was built by 86 artisans. \" src=\"https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_634,c_fill,g_auto,h_357,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F180226202310-18-travel-spots-for-movie-lovers-uk.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This mini Hogwarts was built by 86 artisans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimated to be worth $25 billion, author J.K. Rowling&#39;s Harry Potter franchise has sold 450 million books, produced eight films and, finally in 2017, won an Oscar for the costumes in the prequel &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&#39;s no surprise that more than nine million Muggles have passed through the Leavesden studio where the original eight Harry Potter movies were filmed from 2000 through 2010. It&#39;s still so popular that guests usually book tickets three months in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout a decade of shooting at the studios 20 miles northwest of London, some 588 sets and accompanying props were stored for possible reshoots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related content</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/travel-blogger-film-locations/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Travel blogger tracks down real-life movie and TV locations</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner Bros. bought the Leavesden facility in 2010, investing &pound;110 million ($152 million) to make it one of the largest, most advanced studios in the world. The wildly popular studio tour debuted in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 400-seat Great Hall at the &quot;Warner Bros. Studio Tour London: The Making of Harry Potter&quot; is so realistic that Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling said it made her feel like she was &quot;walking inside&quot; her own head. Other sets include part of Hogwarts Bridge and the intricate miniature Hogwarts Castle built by 86 artisans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dumbledore&#39;s office is still home to the Memory Closet filled with more than 800 hand-labeled vials, bookshelves of leather-bound astronomy tomes (actually old British phonebooks), and the fan-favorite Sword of Gryffindor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guests can enjoy a Butterbeer and mount a broomstick in front of an actual green screen and be immortalized on the Hogwarts Quidditch team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Warner Bros.
