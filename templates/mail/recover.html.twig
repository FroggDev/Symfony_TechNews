<h3>Password recovery</h3>

<p>Hi {{ author.lastname }} {{ author.firstname }}! It seems you forgot your password.</p>

{# example, assuming you have a route named "login" #}
<p>Don't worry we are here to help you, go to: <a href="{{ url('recover_validation') }}?email={{ author.email }}&token={{ author.token }}">Password recovery</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
